VPN aids regular connectivity of AWS and your private om-premises network, it is not a data migration solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. This connection is private and does not go over the public internet. It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agility</strong> - Agility refers to the ability of the cloud to give you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them – from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elasticity</strong> - With cloud computing elasticity, you don’t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost savings</strong> - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability to deploy globally in minutes</strong> - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.

Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted.

There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to spot instances.

You must activate both types of tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Cost Allocation Tags Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt3-q64-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tags help in organizing resources and are a mandatory configuration item to run reports</strong> - Tags definitely help organize resources as per an organization's requirement; they are not mandatory though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, but can have multiple values</strong> - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Only user-defined tags need to be activated before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report</strong> - As explained above, both kinds of tags (user-defined and AWS generated) need to be activated separately before they can appear in report generation.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html</a></p>\n","answers":["<p>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value</p>","<p>Tags help in organizing resources and are a mandatory configuration item to run reports</p>","<p>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, but can have multiple values</p>","<p>You must activate both AWS generated tags and user-defined tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report</p>","<p>Only user-defined tags need to be activated before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report</p>"]},"correct_response":["a","d"],"section":"Billing and Pricing","question_plain":"Which of the following statements are true about Cost Allocation Tags in AWS Billing?
