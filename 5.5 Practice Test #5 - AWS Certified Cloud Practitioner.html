You no longer need to deal with expensive and finicky tape drives, arrange for off-premises storage, or worry about migrating data to newer generations of media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Standard</strong> - Amazon S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data.

This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur. It is a design principle of the Reliability pillar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use serverless architectures</strong> - In the cloud, serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at a cloud scale.

You can choose to manage access just to your AWS accounts, just to your cloud applications, or to both.</p>\n\n<p>You can create users directly in IAM Identity Center, or you can bring them from your existing workforce directory. With IAM Identity Center, you get a unified administration experience to define, customize, and assign fine-grained access. Your workforce users get a user portal to access their assigned AWS accounts or cloud applications.</p>\n\n<p>You can use IAM Identity Center to quickly and easily assign and manage your employees’ access to multiple AWS accounts, SAML-enabled cloud applications (such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and Box), and custom-built in-house applications, all from a central place.</p>\n\n<p>How AWS IAM Identity Center works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/IAM/product-page-diagram_AWS-IAM-Identity-Center_SSO-Rework.45817a4d5cdf0acf33a75257713d3266879196b1.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cognito</strong> - Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the option to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. It is an identity management solution for customers/developers building B2C or B2B apps for their customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)</strong> - AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using AWS IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. It is not used to log in but to manage users and roles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> - The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts. It is not a central user portal.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/</a></p>\n","answers":["<p>AWS IAM Identity Center</p>","<p>AWS Cognito</p>","<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)</p>","<p>AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</p>"]},"correct_response":["a"],"section":"Technology","question_plain":"A corporation would like to simplify access management to multiple AWS accounts as well as facilitate AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) access to its AWS accounts.
